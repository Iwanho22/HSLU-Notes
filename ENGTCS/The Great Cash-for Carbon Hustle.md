## Start of Carbon Offsetting
- U.S. power company Applied Energy developed way to reduce emissions -> plating trees around coal-fired-power station (absorb CO2)
- In Connecticut not enough space -> since atmosphere is globally situate trees elsewhere
- Company paid farmers in Guatemala to plant trees
- Decade later enshrined in international law -> Kyoto Protocol
	- Countries struggling reducing emissions -> compensate by paying for projects
- 20 years later -> officially failed -> led to food shortages -> saved only 10%

## MyClimate
- 2002 Heuberger, Münch and Bürgi invited to sustainability conference in Costa Rica
- Asked attendees to pay to offset emissions from flight -> raised more than 10'000 dollars
- Donated funds to university hosting event -> to install solar panels instead of diesel boiler (Saved 70 tons of carbon each year)
- Registered Nonprofit MyClimate (printed and mailed tickets to customers)

- 2005 Kyoto-Protocol ratified MyClimate got contract to compensate for Fifa WC in Germany

## Beginning of South Pole
- Capitalism works very efficiently -> profit for purpose
- Focus on cultivation projects to sell credits
- Chinese Carbon Expo -> South Pole would help selling climate tickets for solar, wind and hydropower plants
- No cost for developers South Pole would take care of complex carbon accounting and take a commission on sold tickets.
- -> Expanded rapidly (**also concerns about market integrity** -> Developers would inflate environmental impact in order to get more tickets)
- BP took seat in board
- Market flourished -> Heuberger maximized revenue



## Start of Kariba Project
- Wentzel acquired parcel woodland from debtor (endangered wildlife) -> thought land ha little use -> heard of climate offsetting
- Zimbabwe massive poverty and inflation -> project could save trees and help inhabitants
- Wentzel expand project across four large districts -> in exchange 70% were invested in Kariba
- Wentzel founded Carbon Green Investment in Guernsey (Tax haven) 

### Forest Projects
- Difficult to quantify how much carbon is saved -> proof that forest had been razed
	- Deforestation agents simply cut down other forest
	- Could burn down
- Excluded from U.N.'s carbon system
- **Verra** -> Nonprofit company implemented REDD
	- launched by carbon-industry players
	- accredited Climate-Tickets
	- Allowed multiple ways to calculate climate-credits -> Developers choose the  one the most lucrative
	- "If you require perfection, you’ll have a hundred million dollars’ worth of climate action. If you’re more pragmatic about it, you might have two billion or five billion."

### Register Kariba project
- Registered with Verra
- Calculate amount of saved Carbon over 30 years -> tickets issued every year against amount -> checked every decade
- South Pole estimated around 52 million tons saved
- -> Verra required they use their calculation mechanism
- -> 200 million tons saved
- One Credit = 10 euros
- Opened at 2011 -> created community gardens, beehives 


## Carbon market Collapse
- By end of 2012 -> one credit = 39 cents
- Kyoto Protocol obliged polluters to compensate
- Financial crisis, a lot of scams and hacker attacks
- U.N.'s Clean Development Mechanism issued a vast of dubious credit -> no trust
- Biggest Blow => failure of international climate agreements in 2009

- South Pole would serve the voluntary-market -> companies who compensate for reasons of ethics or public relations
- South Pole grew and began with dubious contracts
	- chemical company with no climate value
	- exaggerated claims about projects benefits to local communities
	- Timber companies which would leave tree plantation standing for a short time before cutting them down
- -> Accuse of "**Greenwashing**"-> many employees left

## Crisis with Wentzel
- In the crash income had collapsed -> spendings on for project staff etc. was still there
- Local Elmon Mudenda suggested that Kariba project was a scam
- -> Pressure on Wentzel increased
- Called South Pole and threatened to scrap the whole enterprise.
- Wanted a million dollars -> was paid by South Pole in exchange for 3 million Credits (low price 50 cent per credit)
- In the following year South Pole bought about same number
	- Now not just a broker with commissions
	- Sold tickets self and kept all profits
- Wentzel bribed critics

## First Problems with Kariba Project
- Project-monitors had surveyed that the site has fewer trees than South Pole planned to claim credits
- Rate of forest loss in reference region was starkly lower than projected
- -> **Project doesn't save so much carbon**
- "No urgency" since still years to go until check

## Greta Thunberg fuelling the market
- Since Greta Thunberg in 2018 "no listed company can afford to be on the sidelines when it comes to climate protection."
- Put pressure on Companies
- Companies all wanted to go "net Zero"
- Great Thunberg "denounced offsetting as a dangerous lie" -> still fueled the market
- Tickets South Pole bought directly from Wentzel -> huge revenue Sold for more than 15 dollars
- -> South Pole expanded
- Carbon market grew 7-fold

## Climate-Ticket Stock market
- in 2020 initiative to expand carbon trade
- The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets was corporate Powerhose
	- 400 hundred members -> many of largest Oil companies
- Created "stockmarket"
- -> Greenwashing -> Protest form Thunberg
- South Pole grew with Partners like
	- Gazprom
	- Chevron
	- TotalEnergies
	-> staff (were young and idealistic) thought they cooperate with the evil
	-> Heuberger: "At least the put money into these projects"



## Summary Key-Notes
- About young Idealist started with doing good -> ended with doing bad things
- About North-Pole. -> Company who acts as broker and administrator for climate-tickets.
- If a company safes Carbon-Emission (like wind and water power plants) -> get climate-tickets
- Other companies cannot save carbon emission -> buy these tickets and can do something for climate
- North-Pole sold tickets for a forest project in Zimbabwe which had gotten far too much tickets.
- North-Pole basically scammed companies by selling unfunded
- climate-tickets
