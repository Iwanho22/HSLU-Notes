- High resolution three-dimensional X-Ray to see inside Mechanism
- Fragments were extremely corroded.
- 3'000 images per rotation

## Discovery
### Spring 1900
- Group of sponge-divers had to take shelter by the small island of Antikythera (between Crete and Kythera) in spring 1900
- After a storm, one diver was looking for clams to eat.
- Round about 140 meters deep he found a ship wreck and a pile of human bodies all in pieces
- took one piece, and it turned out it was a bronze arm
### Autumn 1900 - +10 Months
- In Autumn divers returned now working for the government
- brought up many pieces of sculptures -> taken to national museum
- World's first large-scale underwater archeological excavation
- dated on 50 B.C. (Ancient Greece was on the wane)
- Highly suggest that the ship was full of good plundered form Greek temples on its way to roman aristocrats.
- Bronze sculptures could be "saved". -> Antikythera Youth (larger-than-life-size naked young man)
- There were other artifacts among the bronze sculptures, including a shoebox-size lump of bronze which appeared to have a wooden exterior
- other artifacts almost forgotten because the excitement for the sculpture was so huge.
## 1902
- Wooden exterior split open, revealing a bronze dial and precisely cut triangular gear teeth of different size. -> Looked like a mechanical clock.
- Mechanical clock was impossible because scientifically precise gearing wasn't believed to have been used until the fourteenth century.
- Was name **Antikythera Mechanism**
- First analysis followed two main approaches:
	1. a kind of astrolabe (**J. N. Svorons**).
		Astrolabes were used to tell the time and also determine latitude with reference to the position of the stars. -> Sailors, calculate prayer times, find direction of Mecca
		Widely known in the Islamic word by the eight century
	
	2. Legendary Sphere of Archimedes (**Albert Rehm**)
		Mechanical planetarium capable of reproducing the movement of the sun, moon and five planets that one could see from earth without telescope.
		Albert Rehm thought it was much to complex for an astrolabe

	However, because of lack of evidence the first approach held sway.

## First 50 years of research
- Reluctance of modern investigators to credit the ancients with technological skills
- Greek were thought to have possessed wooden gears -> used to lift building materials, haul up water.
- Not believed that Greeks built scientifically precise gears (cut from metal and arrange int complex gear trains)
- **Paul Keyser** (Software developer at I.B.M author of "Greek Science of the Hellenistic Era) Scholars tend to focus on science beginning with Copernicus and Galileo and Harvey -> go so far that no science existed before.
- Almost as if wished to reserve advance technological accomplishments for ourselves.
- Reluctant to share our glory in crafting machines with previous civilizations

## Previous Civilizations were Smarter
- **Peter James and Nick Thorpe** in **Ancient Inventions** published that ancient civilization was aware of natural electric phenomena and the invisible powers of magnetism.
- Greek had famous inventors:
	- **Archimedes** (87-212 B.C.C):
		Invented this famous planetarium (Sphere)
		Invented claw-device to lift ships in the air and smashing it back into the water.
	- **Heron of Alexandria** (around 200 B.C.)
		Described the basic principles of steam power
		Is said to have invented a steam powered rotation device.
		Mechanical slot machine
		water powered organ
		Automatic swinging doors
		Automatons of animals which sing, blow trumpets, dance etc.
- Scholars even though dismiss his description of "Pneumatica" as fantasy because of evidence for all these inventions.
- Lack of evidence is not astonishing -> No one was around to fix them, Mainly popular texts were copied and not scientific ones.
### Why no "useful" machines
- One theory-> Greeks owned slaves, so no incentive to invent labor saving devices (almost found idea distasteful)
- Greeks valued individual bravery in war so they didn't invent war machines
- But is easier to believe the machines never existed.


## Research of Price
### Derek de Solla Price
- Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton
- Physicist but later switched to History of Science at  Yale
- founder of Scientometrics
- Studied Antikythera Mechanism
- Died in 1983
### Research
- Believed that Mechanism was a computer which could calculate astronomical events (full moon)
- Realized that inscriptions were calendrical markings indication months, days and the sings of the zodiac.
- Postulated that there were pointers representing the sun and moon and possibly planets-> moved around the dial indicating their position.

- Assumed the largest gear represents the sun (one rotation equals a solar year)
- Other gears were moved by the gear-train starting by the solar-gear. Movement could be calculated by counting the number of teeth. By comparing those ratios to astronomical cycles, you could determine the figure the gear represents.

- Because many gears were hidden inside the mechanism and many teeth were missing Price had to guess.
- In 1971 allowed to take the first X-Ray of the mechanism
- Price developed a schematic drawing of a hypothetical reconstruction
- In 1974 published Research in "Gears for Greeks"
- He was extremely exited about the mechanis:
	- "Nothing like this instrument is preserved elsewhere. Nothing comparable to it is known from any ancient scientific text or literary allusion. On the contrary, from all that we know of science and technology in the Hellenistic Age we should have felt that such a device could not exist"
	- "requires us to completely rethink our attitudes toward ancient Greek technology"
- contradicted the neo-Darwinism concept of technical history
- Price's work did not change the way the history of the ancient world is written
- His work didn't get much attention
- His work was asociatetd with UFOs, etc, because of the book "Chariots of the Gods"

- According to **Paul Keyser** Classical scholarship is text oriented
- When new archeological discovery arrives it doesn't fit because it tends to worry 
- 
- 
- scholars and scientist, who prefer patterns and collections of data

## Greek astronomy
- Year consisted of twelve lunations or new-moon-to-new-moon cycle (average 29.5 days)
- Problem: 12 lunations take 11 days less than solar cycle
- If no adjustment to calendar seasons slip out of sync
- Often solved by adding a thirteenth "intercalary" month every 3 years -> Methods to calculate length and when they should be added never correct.

- Babylonians discovered that there are, 2035 lunar months in 19 years. -> Metonic cycle -> extremely useful tool to keep lunar calendar and solar cycle in sync (Still used by churches).
- Babylonians also established **saros cycle** -> predict likely occurrence of eclipse -> 18 years 11 days 8 hours after eclipse, a nearly identical will appear.
- It was important because eclipsed were thought to be omens.

- Greeks, Callippic cycle -> consisted of four Metonic cycles minus 1 day. -> more precise
- Greeks' genius was to work out theories to explain cycles -> brought geometry o Babylonian astronomy.
- Fits perfectly into concept of gear work

## Inventor?
- Price called simply "some unkonw ingenious mechanic"
- Speculations that it was Hipparchus
	- Believed to have invented trigonometry
	- lived on Rhodes from about 140-120 B.C.
	- Theory to explain the anomalous movements of the moon
	- Thought to have founded a school on Rhodes where **Posidonius** studied


## Research of Micheal Wright
### Person
- Curator of mechanical engineering
- Helped maintain old clocks 
- Hearty and rational
- prey to wild, impolitic outbursts and overcomplicated personal entanglements.
- Has often disastrous confrontations with people which should be his allies.
- No teamplayer
### Research
- Lebanese man brought artifact which broken in 4 main fragments
- With help of **J. Field** showed that the artifact was a sundial calendar
- Believed that the ancient Greek knowledge of gearing was kept alive in the Islam
- Became interested in the **Antikythera Mechanism**
- Price's reconstruction doesn't explain what we see.
- Brought in practical knowledge
- He posited that there was a ball indicating the moon (one half black and the other half white) and also showed a pin-and-slot construction for this.
- 1990 took another X-Ray with colleague **Allan Bromley**, but Bromley denied to collaboration to him. -> According to Wright, Bromley wanted to be the only name to be attached to the solution
- When Bromley died he got all the data, but at this time the other research team was there with the Blade Runner. -> Wright saw them as competitors
		Old Rule "any other researcher is denied access until the first has finished"

## Results of Blade-Runner
- Images were really good
- Found letter 'M' and 'E' -- 'EM' -> Maybe initials of the maker or part number (45)
- Found various inscriptions -> supported theories that Price and Wright had advanced. (On Fragment E they read 235 divisions on the spiral -> vindicates Price's Idea of Metonic cycle)
- It was like they discovered the users manual inside the machine

- Reconstructed the Mechanism
- Added pointers for twenty-three division in front dial marking months in the saros cycle -> similar to the dial above marked metonic cycle
- Wright almost stayed home when the results were published
- Price things the letters ME were the name of the part what it was before
