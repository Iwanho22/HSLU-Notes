## Introduction
- Dr. Bartholomew states that he was always interested in unusual phenomena (e.g. UFO and Bigfoot).
- With brother published book "Bigfoot Encounters in New York and New England - Documented evidence stranger than fiction"
- Then science and rules of evidence struck him, and he realized that it wasn't there
- People often deceive themselves
- Studied mass psychogenic Illness

## Mass Psychogenic Illness
- People in a group start feeling sick at the same time in the absence of a physical or environmental reason to be sick
- Reversed placebo-effect (If you think something will make you ill, it will make you ill)
- Most people experienced this sometimes
	- Example with Person next to you has head lice -> you start scratching because it 'itches'.
- Symptoms are as real as any condition -> people are suffering
- Bartholomew collect over 3.500 cases of mass psychogenic illness dating back to 1566
- In the past these illnesses happened in isolated communities -> no social medias
- Based on a belief. Since we all have beliefs, we're all potential victims
	- Speak of the devil, and he shall appear
	- Believing is seeing
### The meowing nuns
- In medieval Europe -> cats were considered familiars with the devil
- In secluded monasteries (Nuns lived) tension and stress built up and up
- Nuns started to twitch, shake and meow
- Appeared like they were possessed by the devil
- These phenomena are starting to reappear

## Psychogenic Disorder
- Way of the mind manifesting its feelings, its own stress in a physical form
- four-fold increase in the number of children over 3 years
- difference of traditional tic disorder children:
	- older individual
	- female predominance
	- much more complex movements
	- interrupt all activities
- In a way no real difference to normal Tourette because consequences and stigma is the same
- In order to treat, difference must be figured out
- If you tend to pick up others habits you pick also their tics -> somewhat psychologically infectious
## Social Media
- Outbreak of the TikTok tics happened during pandemics. -> no coincidence (Bartholomew)
- At this time there was much anxiety
- No disease or illness correlates with the tic-like disorder. The biggest correlate seems to be access with social media
- TikTok can raise awareness but also trigger them at the same time.
- Bartholomew -> Social media should come with a health warning
	- Technology, spreading these outbreaks faster and further

## Possible Questions
- **What are psychogenic mass illnesses?**
	A psychogenic mass illness is a phenomenon of a group becoming ill at the same time in the absence of any physical and environmental reason to become ill.
- **Why is social media amplifying such illnesses?**
	Because social media on the one hand spreads this type of illness extremely quick and because you can get sick if believe you are sick it amplifies the illness.
- **What were the meowing nuns?**
	The meowing nuns were a case of a mass psychogenic illness in medieval Europe. There was a monastery where all the nuns developed ticks and even started meowing.
- **Are the symptoms of a psychogenic illness real?**
	Yes, the symptoms are real. In a way there is not so much of a difference between normal illness and a psychogenic disorder since the consequences and also the stigma is the same. If you want to treat them, you must figure out this difference.
- **What does this mean, "reverse placebo effect"?**
	It's nothing more than the placebo in reverse. For example, If you were told the person next to you has head lice it would not go long, and you start to feel an itch on your head because you now have head lice too.
- **Who are the potential victims?**
	Since these illnesses are based on a belief,and everyone has a belief. Everyone is a potential victim of these illnesses.
