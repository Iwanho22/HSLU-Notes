## Summary
Ultima Online was a MMO-RPG(Massive-Multiplayer-Online-Role-Play-Game) back in 1997. Ultima Online implemented a Virtual-Ecology-System which was kind of killed by the Players.
This Virtual-Ecology was created Game-Content and was needed because the developer team hadn't had the manpower to generate the content for such a huge player base.
This System worked similar to the real Ecology-System. The distinguished between herbivores like rabbits, deer etc. and carnivores like bears, wolves etc. At first, the spawned the herbivores. In order to replicate, the herbivores had to eat grass, and there wasn't an infinite amount of grass. If a herbivore had eaten grass at a specific place, the grass there grew smaller, like in the real word and after a wile the grass grow back.
So in order to survive, the herbivores had to spread around the whole map to find grass. After a wile, the population was stabilized due to the limited amount of grass.
Next they spawned the carnivores in areas with few herbivores, as before the carnivores had to spread around the map to find a place with enough prey to survive and also the population of carnivores stabilized itself.

Now the player comes in. The idea of Ultima Online was, that the players would mostly attack the carnivores because there were quests with carnivores, and they had also a greater value.

But this didn't work, because most of the players run around like maniacs, killing everything in their filed of vision. They killed everything so fast, it wasn't possible to respawn the animals in time.

So to fix this issue, the developers tried different strategies, like changing the values of the animals and also creation shards to have fewer players on the same world, but nothing worked. 
In the end they completely removed the Eco-System.

The Lesson learned, was that testing a Product in house is extremely inaccurate. Because the real player approachh the product with a completely different mindsett and they test the product different with their sheer numbers.


## Keynotes
- Ultima Online one of the First RPG-MMO used a Virtual-Ecology.
- Virtual-Ecology to minimize effort to create Game-Content.
- Animals mainly divided in carni- and herbivores.
	- Herbivores distribute where they find grass.
		- Grass does shrink and regrow.
	- Carnivores distributed where they find herbivores to eat.
	- Population stabilized itself, inclusive (reproduction).
	- Were differently valuable for players.
		- Approach to keep players from killing all.
- Players completely eradicated every living thing.
	- It was fun to do.
- Tried to change values of animals, increase Spawn rates and shards.
	- Shards -> multiple Server approach to have fewer people on one server.
		- Didn't work because every one had to be present on a "main" server
- In-house testing doesn't work.
	- Sheer mass of players will test differently.
	- Players have completely different mindset to the product -> different test and use cases.

## Possible Questions
- **What was the Virtual-Eco-System?**
	System which resembles the actual Eco-System. It balances the mortality-rate, the reproduction-rate and the population of animals. Included in this System is also the food for both carni- and herbivores.
- **What are Shards?**
	Shards are an approach to split players across multiple servers. This has the effect, that fewer players are on the same server and therefore the servers aren't overloaded
- **Why did the players kill all living things?**
	Players eradicated all living things just because they could, and it seemed funny to them. This destroyed the whole Virtual-Ecosystem.
- **Why was the Eco-System-Code removed?**
	For Ultima Online the Eco-System didn't work, because the Players completely destroyed it. And the only fund working solution was to ripe all the code for the System out of the game.
- **What is in-house-testing and why doesn't it work?**
	In-house-testing is an approach of testing a product inside the organization which produces the product.
	Overall, it's most of the time better to test a product with real customers because they have a completely different mindset to the product. And also the product should be tested in regard of the possible amount of users.
