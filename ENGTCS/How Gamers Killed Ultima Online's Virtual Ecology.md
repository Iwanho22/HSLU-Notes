## Summary
Ultima Online was a MMO-RPG(Massive-Multiplayer-Online-Role-Play-Game) back in 1997. Ultima Online implemented a Virtual-Ecology-System which was kind of killed by the Players.
This Virtual-Ecology was created Game-Content and was needed because the developer team hadn't had the manpower to generate the content for such a huge player base.
This System worked similar to the real Ecology-System. The distinguished between herbivores like rabbits, deer etc. and carnivores like bears, wolves etc. At first, the spawned the herbivores. In order to replicate, the herbivores had to eat grass, and there wasn't an infinite amount of grass. If a herbivore had eaten grass at a specific place, the grass there grew smaller, like in the real word and after a wile the grass grow back.
So in order to survive, the herbivores had to spread around the whole map to find grass. After a wile, the population was stabilized due to the limited amount of grass.
Next they spawned the carnivores in areas with few herbivores, as before the carnivores had to spread around the map to find a place with enough prey to survive and also the population of carnivores stabilized itself.

Now the player comes in. The idea of Ultima Online was, that the players would mostly attack the carnivores because there were quests with carnivores, and they had also a greater value.

But this didn't work, because most of the players run around like maniacs, killing everything in their filed of vision. They killed everything so fast, it wasn't possible to respawn the animals in time.

So to fix this issue, the developers tried different strategies, like changing the values of the animals and also creation shards to have fewer players on the same world, but nothing worked. 
In the end they completely removed the Eco-System.

The Lesson learned, was that testing a Product in house is extremely inaccurate. Because the real player approachh the product with a completely different mindsett and they test the product different with their sheer numbers.
