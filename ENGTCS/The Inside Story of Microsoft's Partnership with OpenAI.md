## Cooperation with Microsoft
- Microsoft invested over 13 billion
- Microsoft wasn't at the forefront of technology industry.
- Cooperation with OpenAI changed this
- Office-Copilot:
	- Answers question like a colleague
	- Write entire document based on instructions
	- Turn memo int a PowerPoint
	- Summarize a Teams-Call and compile todo-lists
- Installed safety guardrails for AI
- ChatGPT -> Large Language Model
	- In general these applications tends to
		- hallucinate
		- invent facts
		- have a capacy to help people do bad things (e.g. fentanyl recipe)
		- inability to distinguish between  legitimate question and sinister ones

## Kevin Scott
- Grew up in Gladys Virginia in poor conditions
- Got Encyclopedia and (like LLM) read from A to Z
- Bought Radio Shack's cheapest computer and taught himself to program
- Lynchburg College -> Master's in Computer Science from Wake Forest -> Ph.D. at University of Virginia.
- Fascinated by AI. (by that time seen as Astrology)
- **Short term Pessimist and long term optimist**-> you see what's broken about the world and your job is to try and fix it.
- 2003 joined Google -> mobile advertising Startup AdMob -> Went to LinkedIn (was verysuccessfull)
- After Microsoft purchase of LinkedIn stayed in Microsoft -> Condition: **Want to boost people who were usually ignored by the tech industry**. -> AI to empower these people he had grown up with.
- AI could revitalize the American-Dream, AI could turn "zero-sum tradeoffs" into "non-zero tradeoff" (no losers)
- Became Microsoft's CTO

## Start of Microsoft and OpenAI
- Google big Player in AI -> bought everything they could
- Microsoft had intern AI-Department -> few achievements
- Microsoft started looking for startups -> OpenAI stood out
- Mission of OpenAI: "artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—**benefits all of humanity**."
- Had already a cooperation with Microsoft (Used Azure platform)
- C.E.O Altman charismatic entrepreneur determined to make A.I. useful and profitable
- Ilya Sutskever C.S.O particular concerned with preparing for the emergence of A.I. could solve many problems and cause also vast destruction
- Kevin Scott -> OpenAI has a theory of the future.
- OpenAI's workers were kind of messianic about their work. -> relentlessly focused

### OpenAI
- Needed partner with massive financial resources -> because they need a lot of computing power.
- Launched "**For-Profit-Division**" for Investors to recoup their investments.
- Unusual Corporate structure: for profit division was governed by the non-profit's board.
- Board was a mixture of professors, nonprofit leaders and entrepreneurs.
- Most board members had no financial stake
- OpenAI charter was "the nonprofit's principal beneficiary is humanity".
- Board members had power to fire C.E.O. and lock away technology

- 2019 Microsoft agreed to invest a billion dollars in OpenAI -> received a 49 % stake in OpenAI for-profit-Arm and the right to commercialize the inventions.

### Mira Murati
- Grown up poor in Albania in 1988
- Despotic Regime, rise of gangster capitalism and the onset of civil war.
- Participated in mat competitions -> won scholarship in Canada 
- Studied mechanical engineering at Dartmouth
- -> You had to be an optimist and a realist
- Joined Tesla, then OpenAI in 2018

- Scott -> One reason he'd agreed to the billion-dollar investment was that he'd never seen Mira flustered.


## Inventions of OpenAI and Microsoft
- Soon impressive Systems up and running: 
	- Bot that could generate Images
	- Answer question in conversational English
### GitHub Copilot
- In 2019 Dario Amodei -> inputted part of a software program into GPT and asked system to finish the coding. -> Almost immediately
	- Nobody could say exactly how because LLM are black boxes
- Ability was for some people frighteningg (dystopian movies "Terminator")
- GPT mad sometimes also mistakes

- In 2018 Microsoft bought GitHub -> same reason they invested in OpenAI
- GitHub remained an independent division with its own C.E.O to keep the startup culture

- Scott and Murati searched MS division that was interested in code autocompletion -> even if sometimes wrong
- Turned to GitHub's C.E.O Nat Friedman -> GitHub community used to sometimes "wrong code". -> Friedman wanted the tool but had to figure out a way to signalize it's imperfectness

#### Signalizing the technical imperfectness
- Searched name for the product -> shouldn't imply the tool would do all the work
- Tool was more like a co-pilot -> makes suggestions sometimes good ones sometimes not
- Name GitHub Copilot was chosen.

#### Launch of Copilot
- Some inside MS didn't want to launch because of wrong suggestions -> could damage Image
- Friedman overrode all an launched
- Huge success -> within a year annual revenue topped 100 million (Independence paid off)
- Also negative feedback -> programmers feared about their job, Copilot empowers cyberterrorists or unleash chaos if not used cautiously. 
- The more people used Copilot the more they understood it's capacities and limitations




### AI for the Mass
#### ChatGPT
- Release introduced most people to AI
- Fastest growing consumer application in history
- **Leveled playing field**-> like Scott wanted
- ChatGPT-4 -> 1.7 trillion parameters

#### Clippy
- 1996 Assistant Clippy was released for Office products
- Appeared as paper clip with large cartoonish eyes
- popped up seemingly random -> asked the user if they need help by completely trivial tasks
- Hated by the userbase

#### Tay
- 2004 AI Chatbot Tay released -> mimic the inflections and preoccupations of a tee-age girl
- Setup to interact with Twitter users -> almost immediately began to post racist, sexist and homophobic content. (e.g. tweeted "Hitler was right")
- Shut down-> public-realtions disaster

#### Launch Strategy
- MS integrated GPT-4 into office programs
- Created "**Responsible AI division**" containing lawyers, programmers and policy experts -> focused on "A.I. system that benefit society"
- Tested GPT-4 with a red-team
- GPT-4 was alarmingly good in a test where it should pretend it was a sexual predator grooming a child. -> New safeguards were built.
- Building safeguards was difficult -> hard to delineate between benign questions and potentially more dangerous
- Used reinforcement learning with human feedback (R.L.H.F) -> Proposed tow Answers for one question and user choose one -> patterns emerged -> turned into rules
- **R.L.H.F** could not cover everything -> Prompt-engineering -> prohibit GPT to give  instructions to illegal activities
- **Meta-prompts** in plain English appended -> these meta-prompts are quite long
- **Conversation from GPT to GTP** -> computer should ask each other questions and each time something inappropriate was answered Rules were added.
- -> Prompt-engineer -> extremely precises with language to write Meta-prompts
- -> society "was trained" also by this. We wrote laws and each new situation a new Rule is written

- In 2022 MS felt ready to deploy
- Dall-E discussion (Empty-Shelfs -> Covid)
- Scenario was tested in limited public release -> not a problem at all
- -> "**You experiment in public**"

- 2023 Release of Bing with GPT-4
- For Office-Copilots public could enlist as Testing-Partner. (Was asked wich answer was better, etc.) -> Each Copilot was specifically adjusted for the program.
- Everything of these Copilots should make us remember that we're talking with a machine, and therefore its imperfectness
- Users need to "become hackers" -> to change the question to get the desired result (e.g. "Take a deep breath an work on this problem step-by-step" -> 130% more accurate)
- Was released step by step -> MS learned how users used these clients and adjusted safeguards.

## Ouster of Altman
- Helen Toner → had cowritten a paper criticizing OpenAI for pushing the hype around AI
- Altman talked with board members separately about the replacement of Toner
	- Board thought they were played against each other
	- Other people think that Altman didn't try to manipulate them -> his attempt was ham-fisted

- Altman was savvy corporate infighter -> blocked Elon Musk to buy OpenAI
- Controlled information and manipulated perceptions openly and in secret
- Board kept ouster plans secret because they feared him.

- Board believed they could not guarantee that AI wouldn't become dangerous with Altman in place.
- Insider said it is difficult to ensure the success of OpenAI's mission if you cannot hold Altman accountable
- Person familiar with Altman's perceptive: "Board was engaged in a very normal and healthy boardroom debate"
	- Some board members were daunted by their responsibilities
	- Each step closer to AGI -> everyone takes +10 insanity
### Microsoft's involvement
- Microsoft had three plans:
	- Plan A -> stabilize situation by supporting Murat as C.E.O and work with her and see if board might reverse its decision
	- Plan B -> Using companies considerable leverage to help get Altman reappointed as C.E.O. and to reconfigure governance by replacing board members
	- Plan C -> hire Altman and his most talented co-workers -> rebuild OpenAI inside Microsoft.

- First Plan A began -> Tweet that MS support Murati
- Day after firing -> Chief Operation Officer Brad Lightcap worte Memo
	- Firing was not a reaction but simple break down in communication
	- When Board was asked why "Altman was not being consistently candid in his communication" board refused answering (even with the toner case)
- Greg Brockman (OpenAI's president ) and others resigned -> Board remained silent

- Microsoft began with Plan B and conferring with Murati to see if there was a way to reinstate Altman
- Boards answers for future of OpenAI weren't satisfying -> Microsoft and Murati began pushing board members to resign -> Some  accepted if their replacement is acceptable and Altman would not become C.E.O. or board member
- Board found new C.E.O. -> Launch of Plan C

- MS invited Altman and Brockman into MS -> accepted
- Murati and colleagues composed open letter to board -> writer promised to resign and join MS new department unless board stepped down and Altman and Brockman were reinstated.
- Almost every employee had signed the letter
- -> All board members except D'Angelo would resign and Altman would return as C.E.O.
- -> Further governance changes and reorganization of OpenAI considered
- Investigation of what had occurred, including Altman's past actions as C.E.O.

- Best outcome for MS including a nonvoting Board seat
- Board insited on doing the right thing -> Altman is now being watched and new board members who can stand up to him
- AI watchdogs not quite comfortable with outcome


## Summary Key-Notes
- About how AI-Products should be released  -> pose not treat
	- Not in particular overthrow and enslave humanity -> rather in not providing dangerous assistance
- The board of OpenAI fired their C.E.O. Sam Altman -> thought cannot guarantee AI not dangerous with him
- Despite partnership with MS -> MS strategy to launch AI products (after Failure of Clippy and Tay) were cautious:
	- R.L.H.F.
	- Meta-Prompts
	- Signalizing imperfectness of Co-pilots.
	- Computer talk to computer
	- Gradual Release (test by Public)
- With help of MS Altman back and new board.
