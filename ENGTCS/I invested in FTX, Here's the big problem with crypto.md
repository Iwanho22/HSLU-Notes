## Summary
Kevin O'Leary says that crypto needs regulation to be applied broadly in the financial sector.  The relationship between people and cash is unique because they don't want to take any risk.
So the likelihood of people putting a huge amount of money into a system that is volatile, unstable and unregulated, like crypto, is very low.
Who do you call when you have a problem in an unregulated system?

With regulation, crypto could be a good way to replace the existing wire transfer system. These systems are slow and complicated, and crypto could simplify them.
O'Leary drew a distinction between stable coins, which are essentially payment systems, and speculative assets like bitcoin and Ethereum. 

But without regulation, even with stable coins, there will always be people who abuse the system, as the FTX affair has shown.

## Keynotes
- Crypto needs regulation
- People only invest in System if the trust
- Every government tries to build up trust, because all economy sectors are base upon the financial
- Distinguish between stable-coins and speculative assets
- If no regulation, there are always people who exploit the system
- FTX won't change anything
- Dichotomy between "I don't trust the government" and "I hope the government will help me"
- Possibility to replace Wire-Transfer-Systems

## Possible Questions

- **What's the dichotomy with the government?**
	There are a lot of people which don't trust the government, but if they need help, they heavily rely on the government.

- **Why do the people trust the US-Government the most?**
	To be honest, I disagree with this statement. Yes the economy in the US is extremely large, and the dollar is also kind of stable, I don't trust the political System to be sustainable in the long run. I trust European governments like the Swiss, or Swedish-Government much more.

- **What are stable-coins and speculative Assets?**
	Stable coins are cryptocurrencies built to be payment-systems, therefore their value is stable by design, and they try to resemble a standard analog currency like dollar.
	Speculative assets are cryptocurrencies which values are extremely volatile and resembles other assets like gold.

- **Would you agree with the sentence "If you don't trust the government, you could also keep gold bars in your basement"?**
	I partially agree. If you don't the bank-System, you're on your own. You don't have any possibility to get any help, because there is no central instance which regulates the system.
	Until today, you cannot really pay with crypto, so one could say it's the same as hoarding gold.
	On the other hand, I think it would be good if there wouldn't be a single instance which regulates the System. If there would be multiple, I think it would be more transparent.

- **Why doesn't FTX change anything around crypto?**
	FTX was only a Startup and the investor of FTX were aware what they could get, a probably wild success or utter catastrophe. For example, "Lehman Brothers", "Bear stern" "Enron" changed nothing in the long term.
