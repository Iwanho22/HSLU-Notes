### Isaacson
- Biographer don't generally have will to power

- Mary Shelly puts **innovation second**, "The man who built this is a monster"
- Judith Shklar -> **Putting Cruelty First**
- Expample: Montaigne put Cruelty first. Machiavelli not.
	- Montaigne -> put cruelty above all
	- Machiavelli -> "the end justifies the means" -> no ethnics
